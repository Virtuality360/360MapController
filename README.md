# V360 - 360MapController

## Use in another application
In the element you want to place the v360MapController into,
create a div with a width and heigth of 100%
leaflet requires an explicit height, so a parent element must have an explicit height

html: `<div id="v360"><V360MapController /></div>`

css: `
#v360 {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
}
`

## Installation

In the project directory, run

#### ` npm ci --force`

pannellum-react has a peer dependency with react ^16 || ^17 || ^18
npm is looking for 16.x
other packages need react 17+

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### `npm run electron start`

Opens an electron instance that points to localhost:3000

### `npm run electron:package:<target>`

Builds an electron instance for the target operating system.
Can choose between "mac", "win", or "linux"

Builds to the dist directory, with the app in the directory named after the build target.

## Changing the JSON

If you would like to change what the map and pano viewer points to, you are able to add your own JSON

Place the JSON under ./Pano/PanoJSON/

If your JSON points to locally stored images, place the images under ./public/images/

add ``` "<PANO NAME>" : { "type" : "markers",
                "uri" : PANO_DIR + "<PANO FILENAME>"}, ``` to ./src/CONSTANTS/Datapoints.js
